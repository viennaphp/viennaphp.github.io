I got some feedback that these newsletters are way to long, so I'll keep it short this time!

A special thanks to our sponsors, Stockwerk, for hosting our meetups and workshops! Go check them out: [http://stockwerk.co.at/](http://stockwerk.co.at/)

A extra special thanks to Markus Winand for doing the workshops with ViennaPHP. If your applications needs a database boost, Markus can help you by training your developer!

And that's it. Man, that was fast!

Take care,
Sebastian and the ViennaPHP Team
