## The talks

This time, we have not only lawyer Stefan Rapp telling us about licences and what they can do for you, but also Bernhard Schussek, symfony core contributer and original author of the forms component to tell us about the future of symfony forms and well-known blogger Michael Bromley talking about life as an intermediate programmer.

### "Licences" by Stefan Rapp

The OSS ecosystem is very important for every developer out there. To be of use, this contribution will discuss licensing situations for laravel & symfony frameworks (MIT-License), the PHP language itslef (PHP/BSD License) and as a storage backend MySQL (GPL). Things to look out for and stuff to feel safe & cosy around lawyers.

This contribution will also try to be serious but will not succeed.

### symfony Forms: Past, Present and Future by Bernhard Schussek

The Symfony2 Form component is a critical part for many Symfony2 applications. As such, we have been constantly improving the component to handle the many different use cases of our users and to lower the barrier to entry for newcomers. As seasoned Symfony2 developer, all  
these changes can be sometimes hard to track. What about backwards compatibility? Will your business-critical applications break? And the questions don't stop there. How can you get up to scratch with the latest best practices? What can you expect from future versions? And how can you get involved to help things move faster? I will try to answer these and many other questions in my talk.

### Confessions of an Intermediate Programmer by Michael Bromley

Some lessons learned by a self-taught PHP developer about faulty self-estimation, bad practices and humility.

## The sponsors

We found generous companies again who are supporting us in reaching out to even more PHP developers, covering our drinks and snacks and making the evening as nice as possible. I know I am repeating myself, but once again: Thank you very much to all past, present and future sponsors.
