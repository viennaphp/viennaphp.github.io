<h2 id="viennaphp---not-just-talks">1. ViennaPHP - Not just talks!</h2>

<p>The team of organizers (yes, there is a whole team of 3 people trying to make ViennaPHP as awesome as possible!) sat together this Tuesday and it was great. Beside the detailed planning of November and December we managed to craft our vision and goals for 2015. You’ll hear about them at the November Gathering, so make sure to join.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that with this team, we’ll be able to achieve great things. But we need YOU! Tell people about ViennaPHP, forward informations about our meetings to companies working with PHP and make sure <strong>everbody</strong> knows about ViennaPHP. <a href="https://twitter.com/ViennaPHP">Do it</a>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1381117002108863/">NOW</a>!</p>

<h2 id="viennaphp-november-gathering">2. ViennaPHP November Gathering</h2>

<p>To bring you the best content available, we are combining the power of ViennaPHP and the Web Performance Usergroup and bring you talks about Javascript, Performance Testing of Web applications and pragmatic testing. Sounds intersting? It is!</p>

<p>Details: Monday, 10.11.2014, 18:30, Stockwerk (as always)</p>

<p>Check out the talks and all related information on meetup: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/211924212/">http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/211924212/</a></p>

<h2 id="coding-dojo-by-softwerkskammer">3. Coding Dojo by Softwerkskammer</h2>

<p>Getting better at coding is an ongoing task. One great opportunity to do so is a Coding Dojo. Together with the “Softwerkskammer” we have set up a Coding Dojo (Tuesday, 25.11.2014, 18:30, Stockwerk). You’ll work on a problem with another person and try to solve it in unusual ways. It’s great fun and you’ll learn a lot, I promise.</p>

<p>For more information and signup (Only 25 spots available!), check <a href="http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/211924262/">http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/211924262/</a></p>

<h2 id="viennaphp-wants-you">4. ViennaPHP wants YOU</h2>

<p>I said it before and I’ll say it again. We need YOU to make ViennaPHP a great place to be. We are looking for talks for next years, sponsors and people who promote ViennaPHP! Get in touch with me if you are interested.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Sebastian and the ViennaPHP Orga Team</p>
