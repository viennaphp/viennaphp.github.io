Welcome to 2015. This is the motto of the first meetup happening next Monday (19.01) and of course we all at ViennaPHP hope you had a great start. The roadmap for 2015 is exciting and we would be glad to see you being a part of the journey.

In this newletter, we'll talk about:

1. "Welcome 2015" Meetup
2. Ansible workshop
3. Database workshops with Markus Winand
4. Our sponsors
5. Upcoming dates
6. Other news

## 1. "Welcome 2015" Meetup

Come and join us for talks on phalcon (the php framework written in C and amazingly fast) and the all new Drupal 8! **We are meeting on the 19.01.2015 at 18:30 at Stockwerk.** There'll be pizza and drinks thanks to our awesome sponsors.

The talks will be:

* "**A introduction to phalcon**" by Jakob Oberhummer: What's different to a conventional Framework? What are the components, philosophy (ORM,DI,API,.....) ? How do I use it? A small app as an example ofc. No fanboy talk, no benchmarks, just an overview. 
* "**Coding PHP with Drupal 8**" by Wolfgang Ziegler: With the release of Drupal 8 nearing it's time to take a look at the upcoming version of Drupal, one of the world largest open source projects in the world. Drupal 8 comes with a vast number of improvements compared to current stable release Drupal 7. It has been completely overhauled to leverage a modern Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach and to build upon well-established PHP components from projects like Symfony, Doctrine and Zend. In this talk, we'll have look at the Drupal 8 improvements from a developers perspective and get an idea how the system's building blocks like Symfony routing, the underlying Plugin system, Drupal 8's  new Configuration management or the Entity field system work and relate to each other.

As always, please RSVP here: [http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/219443095/](http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/219443095/)

## 2. Ansible workshop

We announced last year that 2015 we'll be having one workshop each month. The kick-off is done by Sebastian with his workshop on ansible. Ansible is an IT automation tool. You use yaml to describe action (like installing a package, putting a file somewhere) and these actions are peformend on the target machines by automatically sshing into them. If you are setting up servers (or are interested to do so), come and have a look.

The workshop will be for beginners and Sebastian will walk you through ansible in a real-life setup.

It is happening on the 27.01.2015, as always at 18:30 at Stockwerk CoWorking. You should RSVP **now**: [http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/219592893/](http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/219592893/) 

## 3. Database workshops with Markus Winand

We are very happy to announce that Markus Winand (trainer, author and speaker on database performance) will be the trainer in 2 workshops about databse indices and performance.

About Markus: Markus Winand tuned Entwickler auf SQL-Performance. Er hat das Buch "SQL Performance Explained" veröffentlicht, das auf seiner Webseite [Use The Index, Luke!](http://use-the-index-luke.com/) auch gratis verfügbar ist. Seine Schulungs- und Tuning-Angebote bietet er auf [http://winand.at/](http://winand.at/) an.

The first workshop, covering MySQL, will take place on 25.02.2015 at Stockwerk CoWorking. We limited the numbers of participants to 25, so be quick.

The second workshop will most likely happen in May and will be announced ahead of time. It'll cover PostgreSQL on the same level as the first workshop.
