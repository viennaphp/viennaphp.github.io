# {{ page.title }}

It's time for the ViennaPHP Database Edition in July. Only one week until you can enjoy **talks** about databases (MongoDB, Postgres), **drinks and pizza** from our great sponsors and PHP Developers to **socialize** from all over Vienna.

Again, we are meeting at Stockwerk Co-Working, this time on Wednesday, 02.07. Pizza will be there at 18:30 so you should be there as well! RSVP here: [http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/184105052/](http://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/events/184105052/)

## The talks

We tried to gather some interesting topics about databases for this ViennaPHP, including Daniel Laxar and his talk about MongoDB in PHP and Database expert Markus Winand who will tell us about Indexes and more to finetune your database.

### "MongoDB with PHP" by Daniel Laxar

While NoSQL has become very popular in other programming languages (like node.js or ruby), many PHP programmers still prefer RDBM systems. We’ll have a look into NoSQL and how it is different to RDBMS. We’ll compare MongoDB to MySQL or postgres and examine when to use the one or the other. Finally I’m giving an in-depth introduction into how to get started with MongoDB together with PHP using plain queries or a high-level ODM like Doctrine.

### "Indexes: The neglected database performance all-rounder" by Markus Winand

Proper indexing is a very time and cost-effective way to improve performance. Yet it is often done in a very sloppy way. This talk explains the organizational misconceptions that lead to sloppy indexing and gives advice how to change it. Finally we will show the results of a short online quiz that reveals the state of indexing know-how in the field.

### "Developing Database Driven Webapplications with phpYouDo" by Manuel Hiptmair

Database Driven Webapplications in general consist of these parts: HTML-Templates, PHP-Scripts and JavaScripts. Most often, these parts are tightly woven into each other, which makes it tricky for the designer to edit the HTML. Additionally, the PHP-Programmer has a hard time extracting SQL-queries for specific inspections.  

phpYouDo tries to solve these problems by separating the PHP-Scripts from the SQL-Queries and the HTML-Templates. SQL-Queries are outsourced to configuration files and HTML-Templates are combined with JavaScript to display the selected records. 

## The sponsors

This time, you'll notice that the list of sponsors is rather short compared to other times. That's because we have some money left from the other events so this time we'll remember all the awesome sponsors we had in the last month and thank them again for supporting the PHP community!

### Stockwerk

The co-working space near Westbahnhof is giving us the room to do our meetup, which is awesome. They also help a lot in organizing the event by making sure there is enough pizza and drinks, everything is set up and working.
