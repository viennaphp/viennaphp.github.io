<p>So, this is it. The last newsletter for 2014. The last event of 2014.</p>

<p>But don’t be fooled. 2014 will finish with a “Boom”!</p>

<h2 id="dev-xmas-this-friday">1. Dev XMas this Friday</h2>

<p>In two days, on Friday 12, our anual Dev XMas will happen. Over <strong>25</strong> usergroups will participate and celebrate the incredible year 2014.</p>

<p>We’ll start at 16:00 with the “Developers and Family” party. Bring your partners, wife/husband, children and everybody else. And make sure to RSVP at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Stockwerk-Coworking-Events/events/210717952/">http://www.meetup.com/Stockwerk-Coworking-Events/events/210717952/</a></p>

<p>Later that night, around 20:00, the “Developers and Friends” will start. Again, bring whoever you’d like to enjoy some time with and RSVP at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Stockwerk-Coworking-Events/events/210720172/">http://www.meetup.com/Stockwerk-Coworking-Events/events/210720172/</a></p>

<p>There is one important rule though: <strong>If you attend, bring something to eat or drink!</strong> We love homemade food and drinks, but there is nothing wrong with buying something instead.</p>

<p>I hope to see everyone at Stockwerk on Friday.</p>

<h2 id="next-meetups">2. Next Meetups</h2>

<p>Of course we are already planning the next gatherings in order to bring you the best PHP content out there. The dates of the next Meetups are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>19.01.2015</li>
  <li>10.02.2015</li>
  <li>10.03.2015</li>
</ul>

<p>We still need talks for February, so email us your ideas!</p>

<p>As far as workshops are concerned, we need people who want to host a workshop. Ideas can be everything from getting started with a certain framework, using a tool/methodology or something totally different. Just get in touch!</p>

<h2 id="all-thats-left-to-say">3. All that’s left to say</h2>

<p><strong>Thanks to all of you for a great 2014!</strong> Running a usergroups is much work, but it’s worth it. I’m really happy we get some many people to join our meetups everytime. Of course I am especially glad that Boris and Florian joined ViennaPHP as organizers and are helping me running everything! Thanks to our sponsors as well who made ViennaPHP a place full of pizza and drinks :) And, last but not least, thanks to our speakers from near and far, who invested their time in preparing and doing talks.</p>

<p>2015 will be even bigger, trust me!</p>

<p>Take care,</p>

<p>Sebastian and the ViennaPHP Team</p>
